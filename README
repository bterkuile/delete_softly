DeleteSoftly
============

Add soft delete functionality to ActiveRecord models. Important information:
This is Rails3 only, no backwards compatibility.

Tested with Postgresql

Example
=======
 class Post
   # Replace normal behavior of object completely
   delete_softly
 end

 class Comment
   # Rely on calling active for this object when needed
   delete_softly false
 end
 
Now the following stuff works:
== The Post model == 
 p1 = Post.create
 p2 = Post.create
 Post.count #=> 2
 p2.destroy
 Post.count #=> 1
 Post.at_time(1.year.ago).count #=> 0

 c1 = Comment.create
 c2 = Comment.create
 Comment.count #=> 2
 c1.destroy
 Comment.count #=> 2 (Since we added false)
 Comment.active.count #=> 1
